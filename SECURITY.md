# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We always provide security updates for the [latest release](https://github.com/hanzos3/operator/releases/latest).
Whenever there is a security update you just need to upgrade to the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

All security bugs in [hanzos3/operator](https://github.com/hanzos3/operator) (or other hanzos3/* repositories)
should be reported by email to security@hanzo.ai. Your email will be acknowledged within 48 hours,
and you'll receive a more detailed response to your email within 72 hours indicating the next steps
in handling your report.

Please provide a detailed explanation of the issue. In particular, outline the type of the security
issue (DoS, authentication bypass, information disclose, ...) and the assumptions you're making (e.g. do
you need access credentials for a successful exploit).

If you have not received a reply to your email within 48 hours or you have not heard from the security team
for the past five days please contact the security team directly:

- Primary security coordinator: security@hanzo.ai
- Secondary coordinator: dev@hanzo.ai

### Disclosure Process

Hanzo S3 uses the following disclosure process:

1. Once the security report is received one member of the security team tries to verify and reproduce
   the issue and determines the impact it has.
2. A member of the security team will respond and either confirm or reject the security report.
   If the report is rejected the response explains why.
3. Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
4. Fixes are prepared for the latest release.
5. On the date that the fixes are applied a security advisory will be published.
   Please inform us in your report email whether Hanzo S3 should mention your contribution w.r.t. fixing
   the security issue. By default we will **not** publish this information to protect your privacy.

This process can take some time, especially when coordination is required with maintainers of other projects.
Every effort will be made to handle the bug in as timely a manner as possible, however it's important that we
follow the process described above to ensure that disclosures are handled consistently.
